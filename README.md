# Manager
React Native / Redux / Firebase mobile app for managing company employees

## Running Locally

Ensure a device, or emulated Android image is connected (Android Studio). Manager is built on React Native and therefore assumes you have node installed.

`git clone https://github.com/MihaiGitHub/Manager.git` <br>
`cd Manager` <br>
`npm install` <br>
`react-native run-android`
